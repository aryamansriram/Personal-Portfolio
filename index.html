                <li>Hateful Memes<br>
                    Trained a combination of Resnet and BERT to classify whether memes were offensive or not.
                    This was done as a part of Data Driven's hateful memes challenge. Achieved 0.678 best AUC score.
                </li>
                <li>Gesture Car<br>
                    Used a hand keypoint detection model to detect gestures and used Robot Operating System (ROS) to 
                    use the gestures as signals to simulate movement of a car.
                </li>
                <li>Flower Classifier<br>
                    Developed a custom neural net to classify different species of flowers from images. Also used transfer
                    learning on pretrained Inception Resnet V2.
                </li>
                <li>Melanoma Detector<br>
                    Developed a neural network to classify melanoma from images of skin lesions. Data was sourced through Kaggle.

                <li>Rover<br>
                Worked as an autonomous subsytems engineer on a mars rover prototype developed to tackle various competitions like
                the European Rover Challenge 2019 and University Rover Challenge 2020. 
                </li>
                <li>MAD<br>
                Worked as a volunteer at the non profit organisation Make a Difference. Taught 9th grade science to children at shelter
                homes for a year.
